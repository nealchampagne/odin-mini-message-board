# Odin Mini Message Board

## Description
This is my implementation of the Mini Message Board project from the NodeJS course of the Odin Project's Full-Stack Javascript curriculum.

This represents the first step in building a free-standing express app, using embedded javascript templating to produce a good amount of the html.

I use a basic routing setup to handle requests to the '/' route. I then used ejs templates to produce the main message board, a form for new posts, and also a message details page.
